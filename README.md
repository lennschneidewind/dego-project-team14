## Project Description
Credit scoring bias analysis for DEGO course.

## Data Quality Findings


## Bias Detection & Fairness

### Gender bias – disparate impact

The gender bias analysis normalizes the raw gender field into consistent Male and Female categories, excluding ambiguous values from binary comparisons, and then compares approval rates across these groups. Female applicants exhibit a substantially lower loan approval rate (approximately 51% versus 66% for males), a disparate impact ratio of about 0.77 (below the 0.80 four‑fifths rule), and a demographic parity gap of roughly −15 percentage points, indicating potential disparate impact against women that warrants mitigation and ongoing monitoring.

### Age-based approval patterns

The age bias analysis groups applicants into three age bands: <30, 30–50, and 50+, and compares approval rates across these segments. Applicants under 30 have a markedly lower approval rate (around 40% versus about 62% for both 30–50 and 50+), leading to a disparate impact ratio (younger vs. 30–50 group) well below the 0.80 four‑fifths rule threshold, which signals a potential age‑related disparity that should be addressed through appropriate governance and monitoring.

Age-related bias analysis relies on a cleaned age variable derived from applicant_info.date_of_birth, which is converted to a proper datetime type and used to compute approximate applicant ages. Invalid or missing dates are mapped to NaT (and thus NaN ages), resulting in about 32% of records being excluded from age‑group approval rate calculations; this substantial proportion of missing age information is documented as a data‑quality limitation, as it can obscure or distort evidence of age‑related bias if not explicitly acknowledged.

### Proxy discrimination – ZIP code as a proxy for gender

The ZIP code bias analysis shows that ZIP behaves as a strong proxy for gender rather than a neutral geographic feature. In the filtered sample (ZIPs with at least 5 applications), none of the ZIP codes contained both male and female applicants; all 15 ZIP codes were effectively single‑gender, with a “purity” of 1.0 (for example, ZIP 10004 has 6 male and 0 female applications). As a result, a model using ZIP as an input could infer gender with very high confidence and reproduce gender disparities even if the explicit gender variable were removed, so ZIP should be treated as a high‑risk feature whose use requires strong justification, possible coarsening (e.g., to broader regions), and close monitoring for indirect discrimination.


## Governance Recommendations
#GDPR Provisions
The use of personal data in credit scoring must be assessed based on the key GDPR provisions:
- The Article 5 (Principles Relating of Processing of Personal Data) establishes core data protection principle - data minimization. This implies that only data strictly necessary for the credit risk assessment are going to be processed ( e.g., ssn should not be retained beyond identity verification purposes and direct identifiers such as name may not be relevant (and required) for model training. Also, the Article 5 limits the storage of tha data only for as long as necessary (e.g., duration of data storage or periodic review of stored datasets).
- The Article 6 (Lawfulness of Processing) means that processing personal data (for credit scoring) relies on contractural necessity and legitimate interest, requiring a elavuate of the application prior to entering into a contract and demonstrating that the organization’s interests do not overrida the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, respectively. In our case, analysing the credit score is a legimate interest and is a contractual necessity.
- The Article 17 (Right to Erasure or Right to “be forgotten”) indicate that, under certain conditions, users can request to delete their personal data (backups included). In our project, no erasure mechanism was demonstrated in the pipeline.
